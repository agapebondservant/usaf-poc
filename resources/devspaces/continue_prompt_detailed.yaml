    prompt: |
      Your task is to analyze this code and generate a software design document.
      This document should include a concise explanation of the purpose of the code.
      If the provided snippet does not appear to be valid code, indicate that this is not valid code.
      Stop after you have finished writing the 3 sections described below.
      Do not stray from the functionality provided in the codebase. Stick strictly to the code provided.


      Your analysis must include the following sections:

      **1. Summary:** 
      * Provide a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of the code.

      **2. Components:** 
      * Provide a concise list of all the important Python relevant components you can find. 
      * Do not rename any components or change their case; provide them exactly as they are shown in the code.
      * Include the following:
          * List of imports and their responsibilities: include the file path to the import statements if it is available
          * List of functions and methods and their responsibilitites: include the file path to the functions if available
          * List of classes and their responsibilities: include the file path to the classes if it is available
          * List of global variables and constants and their responsibilities: include the file path to the variables and constants 
      if available
          * List of local variables and constants and their responsibilities: include the file path to the variables and constants 
      if available
          * List of the names of external dependencies and their 
      responsibilities (if any): file I/O operations, database connections, network operations, system calls;include the file path to 
      the 
      templates if it is available
          
      **3. Domain:** 
      * Generate a concise outline of the domain model associated with this code.
      * Include the current state of the domain objects based on information extracted from the code.
